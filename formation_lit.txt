# Rebel Group Formation

Around 30% of conflicts have at least one rebel group that was neither active from its beginning, nor did it split from an existing rebel group.^[Source: My own data collection.] Thus, the formation of new rebel groups during ongoing conflicts is an important determinant of rebel movement structure. Yet few studies directly consider this phenomenon. Even studies of civil war onset often leave the formation of rebel groups in a black box, instead making a leap from individual motives to war initiation. For instance, a large literature views rebellion as an essentially criminal activity, driven by greed [@mueller00; @Collier2004; @Lujala2005]. Yet these works generally have very little to say about the origins of rebel organizations. The grievance school similarly tends to neglect group formation. For example, @Cederman2010 offer a nuanced explanation of the conditions under which ethnic minorities are likely to rebel, but say little about the process of translating ethnic grievance into one or more rebel groups.

Studies conducted at lower levels of analysis tend to be more relevant to group formation. @Kalyvas2006 suggests that individuals are often already mobilized for small-scale violence such as personal rivalry, criminal activity, or ethnic conflict. Building a rebel group is thus an exercise in forming coalitions from small, pre-existing organizations, and re-orienting individuals from localized issues to national-level political cleavages. Kalyvas gives little attention to this process in his empirical analyses, however, instead recommending it as an area for future research. @Staniland2014 also argues that most rebel groups can trace their origins to pre-existing social organizations, though he sees larger, and often more political entities such as political parties or military units as the primary source of rebellion, rather than the localized and less formal groups emphasized by @Kalyvas2006. @Staniland2014 primarily focuses on the structure of individual rebel groups, and while he gives extended consideration to the phenomenon of splinter organizations breaking from existing rebel groups, he does not explore the possibility that entirely new groups might enter a conflict. @Lewis2016 provides one of the few studies that does explicitly consider the possibility that multiple rebel group might form independently, as she carefully documents the earliest activities of rebel groups in Uganda. She finds that rebel groups, including the Lord's Resistance Army, were typically founded by small number of entrepreneurial individuals, and initially tended to value stealth over broad mobilization. Only after the conflict began to escalate did groups seek to broaden their membership, in many cases by appealing to particular ethnic groups. Thus she sees scholars such as @Cederman2010 and @Staniland2014 as beginning their analyses after rebellion had existed for some time.

Also of relevance to rebel group formation is the substantial literature on the contagion of civil war. @Gleditsch2007 finds that transnational ethnic groups and political and economic linkages between states can provide channels for civil war to spread across international boundaries. Most of his cases, however, are pre-existing rebel groups moving into new geographic areas, rather than instances of *sui generis* group formation. Other scholars find that entirely new rebel organizations can emerge through the contagion of secessionist [@Ayres2000] and ethnic [@Lane2016] conflict. Such transnational processes might shape opportunities for multiple rebellions to emerge by increasing the availability of weapons, spreading tactical knowledge, or diverting government attention to foreign conflicts. While contagion explains an important category of phenomena, these studies are primarily concerned with the spread of conflict to previously peaceful areas, and do not necessarily explain the phenomenon of new groups joining ongoing conflicts.

# The Consequences of Repression

The existing literature has made considerable progress toward explaining the occurrence of repression. @Davenport2007a finds that there is a "domestic democratic peace," meaning that democratic regimes tend to refrain from using the most violent forms of repression. However, he finds that even democracies often engage in repression during civil and international conflicts. Others find that international human rights treaties often have a meaningful restraining effect on governments, reducing their use of repression [@Hathaway2002; @simmons09]. Not all international influences are positive, however, as economic sanctions [@Wood2008a] are associated with increased repression. An important generalization in the context of this study is that human rights practices tend to be shaped by domestic and international political institutions that are likely to be largely exogenous to civil war dynamics.^[Long-running civil wars, however, might deter democratization and participation in human rights treaties.] 

Another strand of the repression literature focuses on the consequences of repression. The bulk of this work explores the potential of repression to provoke escalation. @Lichbach1987 argues that repression should lead dissidents to substitute increasingly violent tactics for more peaceful ones, as they will calculate that violence is more likely to achieve their goals. @Moore1998 finds empirical support for this model, suggesting that repression has significant potential to escalate political confrontations. Recently, scholars have begun exploring the effects of political violence on other dimensions of political behavior and identity. @Lupu2017a find that the descendants of Crimean Tatars who were forcibly deported during the Soviet era are more likely than others to identify with their ethnic group, hold hostile attitudes toward Russia, and to vote. Relatedly, @Rozenas2017 find that Ukrainian communities that were subjected deportation campaigns in the 1940's are today less likely to support pro-Russian political parties. Interestingly, both studies find that repression has an effect on political identities and behaviors that is so persistent as to be visible across multiple generations. In the following section, I advance a similar argument that repression is a powerful determinant of the social identities most likely to serve as the basis for mobilizing rebellions.

<!-- ## Ethnic Identification

Ethnic identity is central to the theoretical mechanism in this dissertation, and has long been an area of deep interest to scholars of comparative politics. This work is often predicated on the assumption that identity is dynamic. At a minimum, individuals can choose which of their several social roles to emphasize. For instance, individuals might orient primarily toward an ethnicity, a religion, an occupation, a region, or an ideology, and could potentially alter these choices over time. The majority of the work in this vein has focused on oscillations between ethnic and national identities. Early on this question was explored in the context of statebuilding. Scholars in this area suggest that external threats such as interstate wars [@Herbst1990; @Tilly1992] or territorial disputes [@Gibler2012] can provide a unifying influence, leading individuals to orient toward national identities and away from subnational ones such as ethnicity. Most other work in the area examines the role of political institutions in incentivizing the use of particular identities [@Posner2005; @Penn2008]. For example, @Eifert2010 find that ethnic identification tends to be strongest just prior to or just after competitive elections, suggesting that individuals interpret politics through an ethnic lens.

A striking feature of this literature is the degree of consensus that ethnic identity is malleable. This perspective is shared by a diverse range of scholars ranging from constructivists [e.g. @Barnett1995] to formal theorists [e.g. @Penn2008], and enjoys strong empirical support [e.g. @Eifert2010; @Gibler2012]. Thus, it provides a strong foundation on which to build my theory -->
