# Repression and the Mobilization of New Rebel groups

## Theoretical Framework

I start from the assumption that rebel groups are drawn from a broader pool of dissidents. By dissident, I simply mean an individual who opposes the government. Dissidents are grouped into a variety of potentially overlapping organizations. Some may belong to non-violent political organizations such as trade unions or political parties. Others may use violence as members of a rebel group. Hereafter I "rebel movement" as a term that encompasses all rebel groups, but excludes non-violent dissidents. In some cases this rebel movement will consist of a single group, if there is only one rebel organization associated with the dissident pool. In the American Civil War, for example, the dissidents were represented by a single Confederate Army, though even in this case there were several militias with only a loose attachment to the main rebel group. In other cases the rebel movement may contain several distinct rebel groups, such as the Shan State conflict in Burma, which has produced at least six rebel groups.

At the individual level, dissidents are likely to vary on several dimensions. First, individuals differ in their level of involvement in violence. @Lichbach1995 [17] identifies five gradations of participation which range from being constituents who may not even consent to being represented by the dissident movement, to activists who engage in political activity but not necessarily violence, to militants who participate in violence or work in close support of such efforts. For instance, civilian activists may provide crucial material and logistical support to rebels [see @Weinstein2007; @Parkinson2013c]. Relatedly, dissidents may utilize different "repertoires of contention" [@Tilly1986; @Tilly2006], perhaps reflecting the resources and past behavior of the groups through which they are mobilized. For example, some elements of the dissident pool might specialize in non-violent actions such as boycott, others on conventional political channels such as elections, while others in engage in violence. In addition to varying across individuals, the willingness to use violence is often dynamic --- previously violent individuals often desert their rebel group, and previously non-violent individuals can be moved to participate in the fighting.

Social identities form a second dimension of variation among dissidents. A few dissident movements are exceptionally homogenous. For example, some separatist movements benefit from a coincidence of ethnicity, language, religion, and geographic location. In most cases, however, there is some amount of diversity along these attributes. For example, the Kurds share a common ethnicity and language, but practice a variety of faiths. Bids to overthrow the central government might be made by coalitions featuring representatives of multiple ethnic groups, religions, languages, and regions. Rebel leaders often emphasize broad, inclusive goals and identities, hoping to gain the support of a large portion of society. Such coalitions are often vulnerable to "outbidding appeals" [@Rabushka1972; @horowitz85], through which moderate, diverse groups lose support to competitors claiming to explicitly represent a particular identity group.

Finally, while dissidents share a common interest in removing the incumbent government, they do not necessarily agree on many other political questions. Rural dissidents might make land reform their top priority in a post-war government, whereas urban dissidents might care more about corruption or modernization programs. Some dissidents hope to take control of the central government, as the Houthi rebels have done in Yemen, while others hope to procure independence or greater regional autonomy as a consequence of the war, as the South Sudanese eventually did. Broader left-right ideological divisions are often present, and doctrinal differences often divide groups with relatively similar views. For example, Indian communists were long divided into Maoist and Marxist-Leninist factions. Even when dissidents largely agree on goals, there are likely to be divisions between hardliners and moderates, who will be more willing to accept compromises and less willing to adopt extreme tactics. Finally, even dissidents who largely agree on questions of policy will still find themselves in competition over the power and private benefits of government [@Christia2012], which are subject to rival consumption. There are a limited number of government positions, and material benefits such as oil rents are finite.

Beyond these variations in preferences, I see three key categories of dissident.

### Dissident Constituents {-}

I label dissidents who do not participate in violence, but support violent efforts to some extent as "dissident constituents." These constituents may support rebels in a variety of ways, including the provision of food, shelter, and information. This constituency is also likely to be a vital source of recruits for rebel groups. In cases where rebel groups are associated with a political party, these constituents will be a critical source of electoral support. Constituents have limited agency with respect to the array of rebel groups they can choose to support. Yet while rebel groups are sometimes able to coerce support, constituents generally have some ability to withhold support. For example, constituents could turn on a rebel group by becoming government informants [@Kalyvas2007]. Alternatively, constituents could flee an area and become refugees or internally displaced persons. Thus, while they tend to have little-or-no direct influence over rebel groups, rebel leaders nonetheless have incentives to be responsive to the interests of constituents.

The most fundamental interest held by dissident constituents during civil war is likely to be security. These are individuals who have elected not to participate in violence themselves. Avoiding violence is thus likely to be a high priority for them, leading them to value rebel groups that can provide protection or steer the fighting away from civilian areas. Secondary to this, dissidents are likely to have political preferences they would prefer to see represented by a rebel group. For example, in addition to opposing the incumbent regime constituents might like to see improved status for their ethnic group or land reform. If the rebel group a constituent currently supports does not have a platform that aligns closely to their interests and succeeds in providing protection, they should be receptive to appeals from other groups.

### Rank-and-File Rebels {-}

Rebel groups are generally hierarchical organizations, with the majority of members having little influence over their direction. I call the rebel group members who do not occupy leadership positions "rank-and-file rebels." Much like constituents, rank-and-file rebels have limited input in group decisions, but have what @Hirschman1970 calls the "exit" option. If members are sufficiently dissatisfied with the direction of a rebel group, they generally can leave to form a new splinter organization, or desert the conflict entirely. As losing a substantial number of members could devastate the fighting capacity of a group, rebel elites again have an incentive to be at least somewhat responsive to their members.

Individuals who join rebel groups often (though not always) do so out of deep commitment to a political cause [@Humphreys2008]. Thus one dimension over which rank-and-file members is political action. If group leaders stray too far from their original platform, or are insufficiently forceful in advocating for it, they are likely to face internal dissent from rank-and-file. Rank-and-file members also tend to have connections to civilian family members and friends. Thus they are likely to support efforts to protect and oppose efforts to abuse civilians, at least from social groups with whom they share a connection. Failure to represent the interests of these rank-and-file members puts rebel leaders at significant risk of losing members through splintering or desertion.

### Rebel Entrepreneurs {-}

Finally, I call the dissident elites who lead existing rebel groups and form new ones "rebel entrepreneurs." I assume that rebel groups generally emerge through the efforts of these entrepreneurs, rather than, say, the spontaneous organization of protesters. Leading a rebel group is likely to be attractive for several reasons. First, leaders exercise significant, and sometimes total control over a rebel group's political platform. Even if a rebel group does not defeat the government, rebel entrepreneurs may be able to secure concessions on a few of their favored issues in post-war peace negotiations. Rebel elites also frequently receive significant private benefits. During conflicts, rebel groups sometimes acquire control of natural resource production, or illicit trades such as drugs. While some of these funds are used to attract and retain rank-and-file soldiers, rebel elites often reap a significant amount of profit.

Maintain political leverage and control of private resources requires a reasonably strong rebel group. As these political and material benefits are often even more plentiful for rebel leaders who defeat the government, they should generally prefer to build a rebel group strong enough to win. Thus in general, leaders of existing rebel groups should elect to be responsive enough to rank-and-file members and constituents to prevent significant losses in members. At the same time, as some portion of the private benefits are often distributed to rank-and-file members, rebel leaders should seek minimum winning coalitions, rather than endlessly pursuing more power [@Christia2012]. Thus rebel leaders may be willing to tolerate some loss of support, placing on constraint on the extent to which they are accountable to members. 

Rebel entrepreneurs who do not currently lead their own rebel group should look for opportunities to do so. This might entail forming a new rebel group, by appealing to dissident constituents with a different platform than existing rebel groups offer, or by leading a group of rank-and-file members in the creation of splinter organizations.

## Group Formation

By "group formation" I mean the entry of entirely new groups to the conflict. In the following empirical analysis, I code a group as new if it did not originate as a faction of another rebel group. A rebel group that draws its leadership and members from a political party that did not previously engage in violence would constitute a new group if it were to take up arms. By contrast, I would consider a faction of an existing rebel group that breaks away to form its own organization to be a splinter organization, discussed in the following section. At a minimum, group formation requires that two conditions be met. First, previously non-violent individuals must change their mobilizational calculus. This entails either participation in violence becoming more attractive, or remaining non-violent becoming less attractive. Second, there must be a division among the dissident constituents. Newly mobilizing individuals must have a reason for forming a new group rather than joining an existing one. At their most benign, these divisions might simply reflect the difficulty of coordinating actions across physical distance or linguistic barriers. For example, dissidents on opposite sides of a mountain range might choose to form independent organizations. In such cases the formation of multiple rebel groups might be a matter of convenience rather than an indicator of animosity or divergent objectives. In other cases, however, divisions may be deeper and more difficult to reconcile. For instance, if some rebels make improving the status of their ethnic group a primary concern, it is unlikely that members of other ethnic groups will join their organization, and any existing members with differing ethnic identities will be likely to leave.

Repression can satisfy both of these conditions. The application to the first condition requires little explanation. Repression should reduce the relative cost of fighting, as non-violence brings fewer assurances of safety. Thus, the pool of individuals willing to participate in violence should expand with the level of repression. The crucial question, then, is whether they join existing rebel groups, or form new ones. I argue that these new dissidents will often choose the latter. First, if significant numbers of civilians have been repressed, they may place some of the blame on existing rebel groups. If civilians provide material support to a rebel group, they may expect protection in return. Being repressed would be a strong indication that the rebel group is failing in this role. Alternatively, they may blame existing rebels for provoking the government into repressing. In either case, they are likely to hold negative affect toward existing groups.

I also expect that beyond changing the cost of fighting, repression should make individuals more inclined to emphasize sub-national identities such as ethnicity. Unless there are already rebel groups placing strong emphasis on ethnicity, a new group may be more able to appeal to these identities. A rebel group that previously emphasized a non-sectarian ideological agenda, or drew support from a multi-ethnic coalition, will have difficulty credibly pivoting to an emphasis on a particular ethnic identity. Recall that I assume there is an ever-present set of rebel entrepreneurs seeking opportunities to build new groups of their own. These entrepreneurs should often be able to propose a new rebel group that makes ethnicity more central to its identity than previous organizations. The literature on ethnic outbidding suggests that these efforts should often be successful. Outbidding is a dynamic in which leaders make progressively more extreme proposals in hopes of winning the support of the group [@Rabushka1972; @horowitz85]. Key to these models are the assumptions that individuals identify with a single ethnic group, that they care only about ethnic issues, and that ethnic politics is a zero-sum game. This produces a completely polarized bargaining space in which individuals choose ideal points at which their group's interests are represented fully (e.g. a preference for a legislature in which group members hold a majority). In a spatial model of voting with such  parameters, the optimal strategy for politicians is to adopt the most extreme position possible [@Rabushka1972]. In Sri Lanka, for example, parties representing the Sinhala majority proposed increasingly discriminatory policies against the Tamil minority [@horowitz85]. Even if a multi-ethnic coalition forms initially by creating uncertainty as to which group will be advantaged, it will eventually be undercut by challengers making more extreme appeals to a single ethnic group. Other bases of mobilization, by contrast, tend to produce more heterogeneous preferences - some members will actually prefer moderate positions - and thus greater potential for compromise. While the original formulation of the outbidding model assumes competition in an electoral context, it has also been shown to more violent forms of competition such as terrorism [@Kydd2006; @Chenoweth2010; but see @Findley2012a]. Thus as individual dissidents become more oriented toward ethnic identities, rebel groups making extreme bids should tend to attract more new members than moderate groups.

While this process should initially re-orient a subset of dissidents around the ethnic identities that are targeted with repression, the mobilization of one group can lead to similar behavior in others, even if the latter groups do not experience repression themselves. @Kuran1998 shows that ethnic identification is interdependent, meaning that if some members of society begin to emphasize ethnic identity more strongly, the probability that others will do so increases. Increased mobilization around one ethnicity can also pose a threat to members of other ethnic groups, leading them to mobilize for reasons of self-defense [@Posen1993]. Perhaps for these reasons, several studies have found that contagion effects frequently cause a proliferation of both secessionist movements [@Ayres2000] and ethnic conflict [@Lane2016].

I thus expect that repression will tend to ultimately lead to the formation of new rebel groups. A set of individuals who did not fight previously will be motivated to enter the conflict. Rather than joining existing rebel groups, however, these individuals will often look to form new ones. Repression should induce greater levels of ethnic identification, which will tend to make existing non-sectarian rebel groups unattractive relative to new, more explicitly ethnic groups.

From this argument I derive three testable hypotheses. First, the probability that a new rebel group will form should be highest when the level of repression in a country is highest.

*Hypothesis 1: The probability that a new rebel group will form should increase with the level of repression in the country*

Second, the ability of repression to create new rebel groups should be moderated by the number of ethnic identities available for mobilization. If a country has high levels of repression, but low ethnic diversity, we should not expect the mechanism elaborated above to produce new rebel groups. This effect should be captured by an interaction between repression and ethnic diversity. I expect that when ethnic diversity is low, the effect of repression on the probability of new rebel groups should be low, as there are few ethnic groups available for activation. When diversity is high, however, the effect of repression should be large.

*Hypothesis 2: There should be a positive interaction between repression and ethnic diversity*

Finally, if the mechanism through which repression produces new rebels is in fact the activation of ethnic identities, we should expect to see this reflected in the characteristics of the new rebel groups. Specifically, the newly-formed groups should be especially likely to draw their support from a single ethnic group.

*Hypothesis 3: Rebel groups that join ongoing conflicts should be more likely than others to draw their support from a single ethnic group*
