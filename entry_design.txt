# Research Design

To test the preceding hypotheses I use a dataset of conflict-years derived from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program and Peace Research Institute Oslo's Dyadic Dataset, version 4-2016 [@Harbom2008; @Melander2016]. This dataset includes one observation for every government-rebel group dyad for each year in which it produced at least 25 fatalities. I exclude all interstate conflicts from the data, and include all civil wars, anti-colonial wars, and internationalized civil wars. The remaining rebel dyads are grouped into conflicts, with all rebels seeking to overthrow the central government considered to be part of the same conflict, and separatist movements grouped together if they are pursuing independence for the same territory. Thus conflicts can contain multiple rebel groups, and countries can contain multiple conflicts. I then aggregate this data to the conflict-year, as my outcome of interest is whether a new rebel group joined the fighting in a given year. This results in a dataset of 2,048 observations, covering the period 1946--2015. The advantage of using conflict-years rather than aggregating to country-years is that I am able to examine the effects of several covariates measured at the conflict level, including conflict intensity and the type of issue at stake. The use of conflict-years does create a methodological challenge, however, as many of my covariates are measured at the country level. To combat this I cluster the standard errors by country. Aggregating the data to the country-year does not substantially change the results.

## Dependent Variables

### Entry of New Rebel Groups {-}

My primary dependent variable in this study is the entry of new rebel groups to an ongoing conflict. To qualify, a rebel group must meet two criteria. First, it cannot have previously participated in political violence. To determine this I use data I collected on rebel group origins (described in the Online Appendix), and exclude groups that originated as portions of different rebel groups --- splinter organizations and alliances. This leaves rebel groups that emerged out of non-violent organizations such as political parties, as well as militarized, but not political organizations such as local defense militias. Second, the group must join an ongoing conflict. I define a conflict as ongoing if it has produced at least 25 fatalities in at least one of the past three years. If three consecutive years of peace occur, I consider the next round of fighting to be a new conflict episode, and any new rebel groups that appear in the first year of an episode are considered to have initiated that conflict rather than joined it.

Of the 503 rebel groups that appear in my data, 83 fit the definition. As some of these entered the same conflict in the same year, 73 of 2045^[Some observations are left-censored, meaning I am unable to determine whether there was conflict during the previous three years as it would predate the beginning of the dataset.]  (5.6%) of conflict-years are coded as having a new rebel group.


### Rebel Group Ethnicity {-}

*H3* predicts that because the formation of new rebel groups is driven by a broader reorganization of society along ethnic lines, these groups should be likelier than others to draw their support from a single ethnic group. To test this I use the ACD2EPR 2014 dataset [@Wucherpfennig2011; @Vogt2015], which links rebel groups from the Uppsala Armed Conflict Data v.4-2014 [@Melander2016] to ethnic groups from the Ethnic Power Relations (EPR-Core 2014) [@Cederman2010; @Vogt2015]. This dataset identifies three forms of linkages between ethnic groups and rebel groups. First, a rebel group can claim to operate exclusively on behalf of a particular ethnic group. The dataset does allow for the possibility that a group could make such claims for multiple ethnic groups, as was the case for several of the South Sudanese separatist groups. Second, the data records all the ethnic groups from which a rebel group recruits a significant number of soldiers. Finally, the data codes whether at least 50% of the members of an ethnic group support a rebel group. I collapse these measures into a single count of the number of ethnic groups to which a rebel group is tied. I then categorize rebel groups as "mono-ethnic," "multi-ethnic," or "non-ethnic," if they have no such ties. The distribution of cases across these categories is reported in Table \@ref(tab:acd2epr).

## Independent Variables

### Human Rights {-}

To measure repression I use the Latent Human Protection scores, version 2 [@Fariss2014; @Schnakenberg2014]. The motivation for this data project is the fact that human rights measures are typically based on media reports, creating the possibility that both the depth of coverage and standards against which human rights practices are evaluated might vary across space and time. To solve this, the dataset uses thirteen data sources including U.S. State Department and Human Rights Watch reports and most major scholarly datasets in a Bayesian measurement model. This produces an estimate for each country-year based on a mix of the data for that particular year and the average score for that country and year. While this creates a human rights measure that is comparable across contexts, one disadvantage is that the units are not inherently meaningful, only providing a basis for comparison across observations. 

The measure ranges from roughly -3.1 (most repressive) to 4.7 (most respectful of human rights). The average score across the full sample of post-World War II country-years is 0.29, while in my sample of countries experiencing civil war the mean is -1.24, with a range from -3.11 to 1.51. Thus, the sample includes the full range of repressive states, while unsurprisingly lacking any states with especially strong human rights practices. For reference, recent country-years with scores around 1.5 include Hungary in 2011 and France in 2007. In other words, these are typically cases in which citizens are generally safe from physical harm, but some minorities such as Muslims in France experience political and economic discrimination. Russia in recent years falls in the middle of the spectrum, with scores around 1.0. Examples of cases towards the more repressive end of the spectrum include Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which had a score averaging around -2.5, and Sudan, which had scores around -3.0 during the genocide in Darfur.

The raw Latent Human Protection Scores tend to be relatively static over time. Yet, my theory suggests that it is changes in human rights practices, in the direction of being more repressive, that should change dissident behavior. To ensure that I am capturing these phenomena, I use the year-over-year change in human protection score. While the average conflict-year sees very little change from the preceding year (the mean change is -0.01), 110 cases experience a negative change of at least 0.25, and in one case the score decreased by 2.52 in a single year. I lag the measure by one year, meaning that I am ultimately using the change in human rights practices at time *t* to predict the formation of new rebel groups at time *t+1*.

### Ethnic Diversity {-}

*H2* suggests that ethnic diversity should place a scope condition on my theory, with the formation of new groups being less likely at very high and low levels of ethnic diversity. I first test for the effect of ethnic diversity individually by including the raw and squared ethnolinguistic fractionalization as predictors. This tests for a curvilinear relationship, allowing for the effect of the variable to differ at moderate and extreme values. The data come from @Fearon2003, and can be interpreted as the probability that two individuals drawn at random will be able to communicate. In addition to testing whether ethnic diversity affects the probability of new group formation on its own, I also test whether it alters the performance of the human rights measure, by interacting the latter with both the raw and squared ethnolinguistic fractionalization measures.

### New Rebel Group Entry {-}

*H3* predicts that the rebel groups that form during ongoing conflicts should be more likely than others to be tied to a single ethnic group. Thus, the new rebel group entry variable becomes an independent variable in this analysis, predicting the ethnic composition of rebel groups.

## Control Variables

I control for several factors that might confound my results. To account for the possibility that human rights scores are simply a function of conflict intensity, rather than discriminatory intent, I include the maximum conflict intensity value from the UCDP Dyadic data. The measure is binary, with a value of 1 indicating that the dyad produced between 25 and 999 fatalities in a given year, and a value of 2 indicating that the dyad produced 1,000 or more fatalities. This measure is moderately correlated with the human rights score (Pearson's r = -0.30). The exact measure of fatalities available for the post-1989 period is even less correlated (Pearson's r = -0.25). Thus, human rights practices are for the most part measuring something distinct from conflict intensity.

Conflicts that already have multiple rebel groups may have some unobserved quality that makes them more likely to have fragmented rebel movements. For example, there might be a history of personal animosity between rebel elites [see @Christia2012]. To capture such effects, I include a binary indicator of whether a conflict had multiple rebel groups in the previous year.

Two standard controls from past conflict studies are also likely to be relevant. One potential mechanism that might produce increased numbers of rebel groups in a conflict is the movement of groups from a neighboring civil war into a new conflict. To control for this possibility I construct an indicator for the presence of a civil war in a state that is contiguous by land using the UCDP Dyadic data and the Correlates of War Direct Contiguity data, version 3.2 [@Stinnett2002a]. As secessionist movements are often (though not always) tied to a specific ethnic group, my hypothesized theoretical mechanism should be less likely to apply in such conflicts. Thus, I include a binary indicator of whether a conflict is secessionist as opposed to being fought over control of the central government.

I also control for several country-level factors. Conceivably, the number of rebel groups in a country might simply be a function of the country's size. I thus include a measure of the country's area in logged square kilometers from the World Bank [@TheWorldBank2015], and logged population and logged GDP per capita from @Gleditsch2002b. The characteristics of a country's terrain might also matter, with mountainous areas both creating more opportunities for rebellion, and more challenges in coordinating rebel activities across space. To control for this affect I include Fearon and Laitin's (2003) measure of the percentage of a country's terrain that is mountainous. As democratic competition might provide another incentive for ethnic identification [@Eifert2010], I include the country's Polity IV regime score [@Marshall2016]. The international context could conceivably play an important role in rebel group formation, for instance by shaping the availability of external support. I thus include a binary indicator of whether a country-year occurred during or after the Cold War.

Finally, the presence of natural resources may influence the functioning of my theoretical mechanism. My theory assumes that rebel elites desire the support of dissident constituents. If rebel groups are able to procure sufficient funds and war materiel through the sale of natural resources, however, they might care little about civilians [see @Weinstein2007]. I thus include a count of the number of locations in a country containing 'lootable' natural resources, meaning those which can be extracted with relatively unsophisticated operations. The resources included in the measure are oil [@Lujala2007], diamonds [@Gilmore2005; @Lujala2005], gold [@Balestri2012], gems [@Lujala2008], and drugs [@Buhaug2005].

## Statistical Model

As the dependent variable in this study is a binary measure of whether a new rebel group entered a conflict in a given year, I use a logistic regression model. For robustness, I examine several variants of the model. These include a model with fixed effects for country and year, and a rare-events correction to account for the fact that group formation occurs in only a small portion of my cases. I also cluster the standard errors by country, as many of my variables are measured at the country-level, creating the possibility that errors could be correlated across different conflicts in the same country. I also estimate models (not reported) with the country-year as the unit of analysis. None of these changes substantially alters the results for my variables of interest.
